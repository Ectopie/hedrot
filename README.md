# hedrot

## What is hedrot?
Hedrot (for "head rotation tracker") is a low-cost and efficient open-source hardware/solution for head tracking. Contrary to several generic open-source head tracking solutions, hedrot relies on and has been optimized for specific widely spread and efficient hardware parts, i.e. a Teensy 3 board (optimized Arduino-like board) combined to a IMU/MARG daughter board with 3 common sensors (Analog Devices ADXL345 accelerometer, Honeywell HMC5883L magnetometer and Invensense ITG-3200 gyroscope). 

The estimation algorithm is based on a modified version of the precise and efficient open-source gradient descent algorithm from Sebastian Madgwick. The technology was dramatically optimized for speed: the head tracker can deliver data at a rates up to 2 kHz. The hardware latency of the Teensy board and USB communication relies below 2 ms. The overall latency (including sensor latency and time constant of the algorithm) was estimated to remain between 10 and 15 ms for typical settings, further experiments are currently being done to measure it. 

## Licensing and Credits
The first development phase of Hedrot has achieved in collaboration with the Conservatoire National Sup√©rieur de Musique et de Danse de Paris (http://www.conservatoiredeparis.fr/) as part of the "Bili" project (http://www.bili-project.org/).

Part of code is derived from Sebastian Madgwick's open-source gradient descent angle estimation algorithm (http://x-io.co.uk/open-source-imu-and-ahrs-algorithms/)
Part of code is derived from "comport", (c) 1998-2005  Winfried Ritsch, Institute for Electronic Music - Graz.
Part of code is derived from Yuri Petrov "ellipsoid fit" algorithm (initially written for Matlab).
